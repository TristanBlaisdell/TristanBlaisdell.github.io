<P>This page is about my future career.  I would like to get my MBA and then eventually take the test to get my CFA.  If I could achieve this I would like to go work on wallstreet and become a Hedge Fund Manager.  I personally am very motivated by materialistic things and I would love to have enough money to buy all the things I want and this career would be able to supply me with this.  I would really like to be able to get a supercar and a nice house.         .</P>
