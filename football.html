<P>Here is my page on football. I played as starting quarterback for my team from Sophomore Year to my Senior Year.  I also played as starting Safety and lead the league in pass yards.  Playing football was a passion for me since I was a little kid and I have always loved the game.  I wanted to continue my football career in college but I broke my arm playing basketball and can no longer feel my thumb. I am still an avid fan of the game and try to watch every Patriots game I can.     .</P>
