<P>At the moment I have two jobs.  I work in Stoughton Massachusetts as an Intern for Diesel Direct.  At this job I have to go to many meetings and work on a lot of paper work.  I like this job because it teaches me a lot about how the business world works.  My second job is as a waiter at Friendly's in Middleboro Massachusetts.  I dont like this job at all because the hours are terrible and it is a lot of hard work but I can make pretty decent money over the summer.         .</P>
